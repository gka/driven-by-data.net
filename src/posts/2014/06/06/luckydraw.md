We simulated tens of thousands of possible draws using the FIFA rules and compared how good or bad the actual draw for each country is.

A good draw means that a team starts in a group with teams that are equally strong or weaker. Repectively, a bad draw is one where a team starts in a group with much stronger teams.

As it turned out, [Mexico](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/upshot/mexicos-run-of-world-cup-luck-has-continued.html) was the luckiest country in the 2014 World Cup, and [Australia](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/upshot/australia-finds-itself-in-bad-spot-in-world-cup.html) was the unluckiest.
