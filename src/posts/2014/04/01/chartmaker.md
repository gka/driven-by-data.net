While working at The New York Times I was tasked with creating an in-house charting tool for the Graphics department and The Upshot. I wrote a [blog post]({link}) about some of the cool features Chartmaker had. Also showed them off in a [lightning talk at NICAR15](https://web.archive.org/web/20151213084124/http://ire.org/conferences/nicar2015/lightning-talks/#aisch) in Atlanta.
