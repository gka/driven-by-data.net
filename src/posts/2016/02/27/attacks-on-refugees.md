For this graphic I was only helping out with finding the [data source](https://github.com/ax3l/chronik-vorfaelle/blob/data/vorfaelle.csv) and categorizing the individual incidents (mostly derived from police reports) using a set of [sad regular expressions](https://twitter.com/driven_by_data/status/697541485114355713).

Maps and charts all done by [Tim Wallace](https://timwallace.net/).
