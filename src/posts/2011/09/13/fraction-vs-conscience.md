This polar [lollipop](https://datavizproject.com/data-type/lollipop-chart/) chart shows how the "close" members of coalition parties have voted in roll-call votes in the German Bundestag. The more closer the faction vote, the closer the symbols move to the center. This way one can quickly find votes, where members were freed from their party discipline, such as the CDU/CSU MPs on issues of genetic engineering.
