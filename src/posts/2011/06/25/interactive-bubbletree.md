Based on the [original designs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/okfn/4624235540/in/set-72157623975681301/) by [David McCandless](https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/) I re-created the bubble visualization for the Open Knowledge Foundations project [Where Does My Money Go](https://wheredoesmymoneygo.org/bubbletree-map.html). The visualization is built on top of [RaphaelJS](https://raphaeljs.com/).

Released as an [open source](https://github.com/okfn/bubbletree/) JavaScript library, it has since then been used by designers and [journalists](https://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2011/oct/26/public-spending-uk-government-department?CMP=twt_gu) around the world.
