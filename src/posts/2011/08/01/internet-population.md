With this map I tried to visualize the [global digital divide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_digital_divide). It shows more than 80,000 populated places in blue and about 350,000 locations of IP addresses in red. White dots indicate places where many people live and many IP addresses are available.

The IP address locations are taken from the [GeoLiteCity database by MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity). The database of populated places is taken from [geonames.org](https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/cities1000.zip). The visual style is largely inspired by Eric Fischerâ€™s wonderful [Flickr-vs-Twitter maps](https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/sets/72157627140310742/). Also, here you can find a [high resolution version](https://driven-by-data.net/vis/internet_and_population_hires.png) and the separate layers for [population](https://driven-by-data.net/vis/population.png) and [internet addresses](https://driven-by-data.net/vis/internet.png).
