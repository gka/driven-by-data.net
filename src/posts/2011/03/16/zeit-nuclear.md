title: Population near Nuclear Reactors in Germany
info: I pitched my idea to Zeit Online, and together we build this interactive map within five days! At that time, this was among of the most trafficed interactive features at zeit.de.

Created for ZEIT ONLINE, this interactive map shows how many people live within a changable radius around active nuclear power reactors. It is based on my previous static maps of [shortest distances to nuclear reactors](/about/nuclear-distances).
