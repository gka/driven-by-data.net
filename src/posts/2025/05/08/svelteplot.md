In October 2023 I took a longer break from Datawrapper. During that time I got [fascinated](https://www.vis4.net/blog/2024/01/svelteplot/) by the idea to rewrite [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). It took me some time, but in May 2025 I released the first public alpha version at the [Svelte Summit in Barelona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqkx-RO6PEs).

Say [Hi to SveltePlot](https://www.vis4.net/blog/2025/05/hello-svelteplot/)!
